Generalized version by Zhiwen.

All parameter bounds and options for software running (including main software and evaluation software) are moved into YAML config files.

YAML config files: stringtie.yml and scallop.yml should be placed under autoparadvisor directory. (test version, for now)

Additional packages required:
-YAML library for python
    pip install pyyaml
-YAML module for perl
    install YAML
    install YAML::XS
    tips: could use cpan for perl module installation
